I don't know why
I just feel I'm better off staying in the same room I was born in
I look outside and see a whole world
Better off without me in it trying to transform it

You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seeing my side, oh
You waste all of this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind
Yeah

Listen, I know
This one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds
But the lyrics are so down
It's okay though
Because it represents, wait, better yet it is
Who I feel I am right now

You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seeing my side, oh
You waste all this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind

Heard you say, "not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, there's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

Oh, don't you test me, no
Just because I play the piano
Doesn't mean I, I'm not willing to take you down
I'm sorry

I'm, I'm out of my mind, oh
I'm not seeing things right, oh
I waste all this time trying to run from you
But I'm, I'm out of my mind

Heard you say, "not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, there's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah.. Ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah.. Ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You are out of my mind
You aren't seeing my side
You waste all of this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind

Heard you say, "not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, there's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

Buh buh bah, buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah (Not today)
Bah bah bah bah bah (Not today), bah bah bah bah bah (Not today)
Buh buh bah (No, not today), buh buh bah (Not today)
(Oh nah nah no) Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah (No) bah (No)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
