I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you

Though I'm weak
And beaten down
I'll slip away into the sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out
You're underneath

I’ve got two faces
Blurry’s the one I’m not
I’ve got two faces
Blurry’s the one I’m not
I need your help to take him out
I need your help to take him out

Though I'm weak
And beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out
You're underneath
Though I'm weak
And beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out
You're underneath

Don’t let me be gone
Don’t let me be gone
Don’t let me be gone
Don’t let me be gone
Don't let me be!
Don't let me be!
Oh, yeah!

I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
